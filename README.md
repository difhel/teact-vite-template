# Vite + TypeScript + Teact project template
## What is it?
This is a minimal example of a web application written in TypeScript that uses the Teact framework (an analogue of React) and the modern build tool Vite.

Teact is a high-performance reimplementation of React's functional approach with render optimization based on DOM rendering phases. It was developed by [@Ajaxy](https://github.com/ajaxy) for the official web version of Telegram (Telegram Web A) during the [JavaScript Telegram contest](https://t.me/contest/6) at 2019.
